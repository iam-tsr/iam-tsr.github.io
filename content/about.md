I’m an AI/ML developer passionate about pushing the boundaries of language and vision intelligence. Over the past two years, I’ve contributed to the open-source and AI community through projects with Hugging Face, FOSS, and several personal research initiatives.

My expertise lies in transformer architectures, understanding them from both a mathematical and low-level implementation perspective. I’ve developed a strong foundation in model optimization techniques, including distillation, quantization, and pruning, and in converting models into efficient, deployable formats using ONNX and ONNX Runtime (ORT). Currently, I’m diving deeper into inference compilers and engines like TensorRT and vLLM to further enhance model performance and scalability.

I’m also involved in an ongoing open-source project for Fedora OS, focused on real-time object segmentation using computer vision models.

My long-term mission is to advance Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to create a real-time multilingual translation system — bridging communication seamlessly through AI.
