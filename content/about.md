Yo ;)

I’m a **b.tech student specializing in machine learning**, passionate about advancing the frontiers of language and speech intelligence. Over the past few years, I’ve actively contributed to the [FOSS](https://fossunited.org/) and [AI communities](#) through various personal projects and research initiatives.

My **expertise lies in language models**, understanding them from both a mathematical and low-level implementation perspective. I’ve developed a strong foundation in model optimization techniques, and in converting models into efficient, deployable formats. Currently, I’m diving deeper into inference compilers and engines for further enhancement in model performance and scalability.

I’m also involved in an ongoing open-source project for Fedora Linux, focused on real-time object segmentation using computer vision models - [Repository](https://github.com/iam-tsr/obs-background-remover).

I've **four years of experience in visual designing**, working both as a freelancer at [Vividly](https://vividly.wtf/) (2022/25) and as an employee at [Cimpress](https://cimpress.com/) (Feb 25 - Aug 25). My journey began back in 9th grade, driven by a strong passion for creativity and design - [Behance](https://www.behance.net/dark17_artz).

My long-term mission is to advance NLU and ASR to create a real-time multilingual translation system — bridging communication seamlessly through AI.
